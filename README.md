GalacticGenisys
===================

__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition & Windows 10 Edition Beta__

Introduction
-------------
Genisys is one of several derived projects resulting from the inactivity of **[PocketMine/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP)**. It has many gameplay features implemented which PocketMine-MP does not since Minecraft PE v0.11.
However, this project has been abandoned by most of its active developers, and the project quality has been lowered by too many people touching code without understanding side effects.
